# C#Fundamentals

Hello and welcome to my C# fundamentals quick reference code. 

This is meant to be a basic reference for concepts, and then applying a more complex version on your own.

I will continue to add, and improve each section and please submit what you believe should be added or changed. 

The goal is to make a really good quick reference collection!

MOST USED CASES AND SHORT. 

Thank you!
